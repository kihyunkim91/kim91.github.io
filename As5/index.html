                <h1>K-POP History</h1>
                <p style="color: black; font-size:22px;"><span style="color: #ffc42c;float: left;font-size: 80px;line-height: 60px;padding-top: 4px;padding-right: 8px;padding-left: 3px;">K</span>-pop, which has been sung since the mid- to late 1990s starting with "H.O.T," was the main stream in Asia, but it was nothing more than a "subculture" in the world. K-pop music began in the 1980s by absorbing the characteristics of Japanese and American idols and the change that people do not just listen to music, but they also watch the stage and music videos. Then, It went further and helped create a new "Korean pop" frame by not only accepting foreign genres but also trying to differentiate itself. With Korean-style management added to this, K-pop is finally born. 
                    <p class="indent-text">The early idols have emerged dedicated and organized K-pop fandom and demonstrated the potential of overseas music markets in China and elsewhere. K-pop has given birth to the new term "hallyu," which also called “K-wave” offering a new industrial model of its own.</p>
                    <p class="indent-text">In the 2000s, iTunes and YouTube emerged as the dominant media as they entered the era of digital music. In particular, K-pop was a content that had been optimized for YouTube, a video platform, as it placed a greater emphasis on what appeared to be music videos and stages than music from other countries. Based on excellent visuals, group dances and colorful fashion, K-pop is quickly expanded. Accordingly, K-pop fandom expanded K-pop's influence by launching activities such as editing videos, subtitling and uploading reaction videos on SNS.</p>
